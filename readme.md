# 🧠 Chat With CSV – AI-Powered Data Exploration Tool  
### 📍 DataSense AI Project Challenge #3

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to **Challenge #3** of the **DataSense AI Project Challenge** Series!

This time, your mission is to build a real-world AI tool that lets users **upload a CSV file and interact with it using natural language queries** – get answers, charts, and summaries instantly using an LLM backend.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **production-ready FastAPI app**, deploy it to **Vercel**, and allow users to:

- Upload a `.csv` file
- Ask questions like:  
  - "Top 10 customers by revenue?"
  - "Plot a bar chart of monthly sales"
  - "Show all rows where profit < 0"
- Get answers via text or charts, powered by **OpenAI and Python**

---

## 🧠 Who Can Participate

This project is open to:
- Data science and ML learners (beginner to advanced)
- Backend & Python developers interested in LLMs
- Working professionals looking to build a **portfolio-worthy project**
- Students who want guided, real-world AI experience
